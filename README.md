#### Keyboard Shortcuts Support

Keyboard shortcuts are generated at launch.  
Static bookmarks are given priority so that adding bookmarks dont mess up existing ones you are used to.  
Uses two available letters. E.g. press `gi` to launch github.  
To get the shortcuts, press `?`. Escape hides this popup.  
To use the search, press `spacebar` to focus the google search box

Entries persist across sessions

#### Unobstructive random quote generator without any API

The quote list is completely customisable. See `data` folder.
For version increments of quote, ensure to dump up version number in `data/quotes-version.json`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pradyumnac/newslauncher.git
cd newslauncher
```

### 2. **Run Locally**

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

> [!Tip]
> v1.html, v2.html, v3.html are iterations.
> For my dev purposes, I have hardlinked index.html from the version I am working on ( v3).

Or use a local server for PWA features:

```bash
npx serve .
# or use python
python -m http.server
```

## ⚙️ Customization Guide

### 🔗 Add Default Bookmarks

Modify the HTML inside the `<main>` section under `.bookmark-group`.

```html
<a href="https://www.reddit.com"> <i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> Reddit </a>
```

### 🎨 Add / Edit Themes

Themes are defined as CSS variables inside `<style>`:

```css
body.theme-night {

You can add your own by modifying the CSS and `<select>` options.
